  "title": "Fire Punch (Unfinished)",
  "description": "In the not-too-distant past, the Ice Witch blanketed the world in snow, starvation and madness, leading the inhabitants to seek their salvation in fire. With that, an unusual destiny unfolds for two young orphans, Agni and Luna, blessed with the ability to regenerate. But will this ability prove to be more of a curse than a blessing?\n\n↓ NOTES ↓\nHuge thanks to Shizu for uploading this to Nyaa.si!\nNyaa.si link: https://nyaa.si/view/1238055\n\nAnd also, from what I searched. There are no titles for these chapters beside \"Chapter X\" (Chapter 1 seems like an exception). So if there IS titles for these chapters please contact me on Discord (tag below) and if you can, tell me the titles for each individual chapters. Thank you!\n\nNotice anything missing or incorrect? If so, please contact me on Discord: Rioki#3797",
